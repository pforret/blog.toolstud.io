So you&#8217;re thinking about buying a new dSLR or system camera? You know that megapixels matter! But how much is enough? Let&#8217;s compare your camera&#8217;s resolution to some others!

The Canon EOS 5D (Mark 1) was launched in 2005 and this started the era of the semi-pro dSLR cameras. The camera has a maximal resolution of `4368` x `2912` , which means [12.72 megapixels](https://toolstud.io/photo/megapixel.php?width=4368&height=2912&calculate=compressed&compare=photo&title=Canon+EOS+5D+MkI%3A+12.72+megapixel#compare). For today&#8217;s standards this is very low. Its most recent successor, the Canon 5Ds has a resolution of [`8688` x `5792`](https://toolstud.io/photo/megapixel.php?width=8688&height=5792&calculate=compressed&compare=photo&title=Canon+EOS+5Ds%3A+50.32+megapixel#compare) , this means [50 megapixels](https://toolstud.io/photo/megapixel.php?width=8688&height=5792&calculate=compressed&compare=photo&title=Canon+EOS+5Ds%3A+50.32+megapixel#compare), and this is about as high as you can get with a budget under 4000$. The most pixels you can buy in a commercial camera, should be the PhaseOne IQ4, that&#8217;s [150 megapixels](https://toolstud.io/photo/megapixel.php?width=14204&height=10652&calculate=compressed&compare=photo&title=PhaseOne+IQ4+150MP%3A+151.3+megapixel#compare). The price is equally impressive: about 50.000$.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
