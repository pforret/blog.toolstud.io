I started with some financial calculators:

  * <http://toolstud.io/finance/mortgage.php> &#8211; for calculating the monthly payments and total value of a mortgage loan
  * <http://toolstud.io/finance/mileage.php> &#8211; for calculating how much you spend on gas in a year

I might make more later.
