#### 2006 &#8211; 2015: tinkering with ASP

I started developing small web tools all the way back in 2004. 
I think the first one was a simple RGB â‡† CMYK converter. 
The only scripting language I knew back then was [ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) (Windows/IIS), 
so I developed a set of ASP-based tools. 
They followed my interests: musical (BPM), crypto, sudoku, web-development&#8230; 
I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP while developing them, and the experience helped me a lot. 
In 2006 I decided to make them all available under one domain name. This was **web.forret.com**.

#### 2009: web.forret.com

Then, around 2009 I started working more and more exclusively with PHP. 
After a while, it became hard to go back and fix ASP bugs, 
so I left web.forret.com as it was, on its ASP island and dove into this new PHP world. 
I started developing tools in PHP, things like an RSS feed checker, a depth-of-field calculator. 
However, I couldn&#8217;t put these tools on the same server as the older ones, 
because that server only did ASP, no PHP. 
I started by parking them under **tools.forret.com**, later hdslr-cinema.com with some others, 
and it just looked like a big mess. Different layouts, different sub-domains, different logic.

#### 2015: start of [toolstud.io](https://toolstud.io)

In 2015, I finally decided that I should clean up and consolidate. 
I purchased this new domain name **toolstud.io**, used better PHP templating, source code version control, 
a more modern layout, and the some self-developed libraries. 
I started the work of converting my ASP-based tools to PHP. 
It's not rocket science, and every tool in PHP worked better than the old ASP one, but I just needed to find the time.

### 2016: only toolstud.io

In June 2016 my old hosting (the ASP one) expired, I forgot to pay in time, 
and I decided that I would redirect all traffic to toolstud.io, even if it didn't have all the old tools yet. 
It just doesn't make any sense to pay for two different hosts for a small side-project.

### 2019: Laravel influence

In 2019, I started developing in Laravel and as a result, became more critical on code style 
and started using more external libraries. This website hasn't been ported to Laravel yet, 
because I haven't found the time yet. I did upgrade to the latest version of bootstrap, fontawesome, jquery ...

I hope you enjoy these tools and that they make your life easier.

Cheers, Peter.
