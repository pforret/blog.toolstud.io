I developed a calculator to [estimate the file sizes of a DCP (Digital Cinema Package).](https://toolstud.io/video/dcpsize.php) This is probably a very geeky thing to do, but I need it often for my work (I work in Digital Cinema).<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized">

  <p>
    DCP stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Cinema_Initiatives">Digital Cinema Package</a>, the file/folder format for <strong>digital cinema projection.</strong> DCP specifies the way to combine MXF (<span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">Material eXchange Format</span></span>) media files for audio, video and subtitles into a folder structure and the XML files that describe what each file is, in what order and combination to play them correctly.

The tool currently supports: 

  * pixel dimensions (resolution): 2K/4K
  * framerate: 24,25,48,60 fps (HFR)
  * stereoscopic: 2D/3D
  * Channel layout: stereo, 5.1, 7.1
