The standards for bandwidth in mobile data vary depending on the generation of mobile network technology being used. Here are some common standards for bandwidth in mobile data:

* 2G (Second Generation): 2G networks typically provide data speeds in the range of 9.6 kbps (kilobits per second) to 384 kbps, with a typical bandwidth of 200 kHz.

* 3G (Third Generation): 3G networks offer faster data speeds compared to 2G, typically ranging from 384 kbps to 42 Mbps (megabits per second), with a typical bandwidth of 5 MHz.

* 4G (Fourth Generation): 4G networks provide even faster data speeds compared to 3G, typically ranging from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps (gigabits per second), with a typical bandwidth of 20 MHz or more. LTE stands for Long-Term Evolution, and it is a standard for wireless broadband communication that is commonly referred to as 4G (Fourth Generation) technology. LTE is a widely used mobile network standard that provides high-speed wireless data communication for mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and other connected devices.

* 5G (Fifth Generation): 5G networks offer significantly faster data speeds compared to 4G, with theoretical peak speeds of up to 10 Gbps or higher. The bandwidth in 5G can vary from tens of megahertz (MHz) to hundreds of megahertz (MHz) or even more, depending on the specific frequency bands used. It's important to note that 5G technology is a global effort involving a wide range of stakeholders from different countries, organizations, and sectors. The development of 5G has been a complex and ongoing process, and it continues to evolve with ongoing research, innovation, and standardization efforts to further enhance and optimize 5G networks and services.

It's important to note that actual data speeds and bandwidth may vary depending on factors such as network congestion, signal strength, device capabilities, and network deployment. Mobile network operators may also allocate different amounts of bandwidth in different regions or for different use cases, which can affect the actual data speeds experienced by users.
