I finally got around to do a big upgrade of this site: 

  * upgrade to Bootstrap/[Bootswatch](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/) 4.5
  * upgrade to [Fontawesome 5.9](https://fontawesome.com/)
  * better responsive layout (for mobile devices)
  * more uniform formatting<figure class="wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2">
