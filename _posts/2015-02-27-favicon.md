I needed a favicon for the site, I quickly made one, and when I looked for an online favicon generator, I found <http://www.favicon-generator.org/,> who not only makes the favicon, but also the icons for Apple iOS and Android apps (you can save a web page as an app on your phone, and then its icon is also the favicon).

The favicon tool was developed by Dan, who apparently had the same idea as me with a different set of tools. Thanks [Dan](http://www.danstools.com/)!
