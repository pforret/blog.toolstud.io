In June 2016 my old hosting expired, I forgot to pay in time, and I decided that I would redirect all traffic to this new server, even if it didn’t have all the old tools yet. It just doesn’t make any sense to pay for two different hostings for a small side-project.

If there is a tool that you used a lot, and you would really like to see it back, please contact me on peter@toolstud.io and ask about it. It is not just a copy/paste I have to do, I need to convert it from ASP to PHP and I need time for that.
