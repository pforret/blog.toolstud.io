A second tool I made this weekend solves a problem I have been thinking about since my first Commodore 64, i.e. a loooong time ago: if an octave is a factor of 2 (A5 is double the frequency of A4), then how does one divide that interval in 12 semitones? I have learnt in the mean time that there are 2 major conventions: the **equal tempered system** (every semitone is the same interval: so = 2 ^ 1/12) or the **just/pure intonation** system, where intervals are chosen to match with simple fractions like 3/2 and 5/4.

So using this, I have created a [musical scale generator](https://toolstud.io/music/scale.php), that lists chromatic, pentatonic, hexatonic, major, minor scales and gives the base frequency for each note.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Developing this took me two days because I really wanted to understand and &#8216;feel&#8217; the numbers.

Also check the [frequency to musical note tool](/music/2020/11/01/frequency-to-musical-note-converter/) I also made this weekend!
