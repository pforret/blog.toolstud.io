The following electric vehicles (EVs) have some of the largest battery capacities available on the market:

* Tesla Model S Plaid+: The Tesla Model S Plaid+ is expected to have a battery capacity of over [200 kWh](https://toolstud.io/calculate/battery.php?compare=cars&energy=200&energy_unit=kWh), making it one of the EVs with the largest battery capacity. However, it should be noted that as of September 2021, the production of the Model S Plaid+ has been delayed and its exact specifications, including the battery capacity, may be subject to change.

* Lucid Air Dream Edition: The Lucid Air Dream Edition is a luxury EV that is equipped with a battery pack with an estimated capacity of [113 kWh](https://toolstud.io/calculate/battery.php?compare=cars&energy=113&energy_unit=kWh), which is currently one of the largest battery capacities available in a production EV.

* Porsche Taycan Turbo S: The Porsche Taycan Turbo S is a high-performance EV that comes with a battery pack with an estimated capacity of [93.4 kWh](https://toolstud.io/calculate/battery.php?compare=cars&energy=93%2C4&energy_unit=kWh), making it one of the EVs with a relatively large battery capacity.

* Audi e-tron GT: The Audi e-tron GT is a luxury EV that is equipped with a battery pack with an estimated capacity of [93.4 kWh](https://toolstud.io/calculate/battery.php?compare=cars&energy=93%2C4&energy_unit=kWh), similar to the Porsche Taycan Turbo S, which makes it one of the EVs with a relatively large battery capacity.

* Rivian R1T/R1S: The Rivian R1T is an all-electric pickup truck, and the R1S is an all-electric SUV, both produced by Rivian. Both vehicles are expected to have a battery pack with a capacity of up to [180 kWh](https://toolstud.io/calculate/battery.php?compare=cars&energy=180&energy_unit=kWh), which would make them among the EVs with the largest battery capacities once they are released.
