There has been a lot of talk about exponential growth the last few weeks, regarding the spread of COVID-19. 
It can be a tough concept to get your head around. 
If you hear "_It doubles every week_", ok so that means what for next month? Times 8? Times 16?
I wanted to make an easy calculate exponential (going up) and logarithmic (going down) phenomena.

Introducing the **[Exponential Growth Calculator](https://toolstud.io/calculate/exponential.php)**! Just add two data points and let the tool extrapolate.

Some examples:

  * Carbon-14 has a [radioactive half-life of 5730 years](https://toolstud.io/calculate/exponential.php?datapoint1=2&datapoint2=1&timeinbetween=5730&timeinbetween_unit=31536000) (logarithmic decay)
  * Growth of people infected by [COVID-19 in the USA between 15 and 29 March 2020](https://toolstud.io/calculate/exponential.php?datapoint1=1714&datapoint2=103321&timeinbetween=14&timeinbetween_unit=86400) (exponential growth)
  * Social Media: [Facebook grew from 1 mio MAU in 2004 to 2.32 bil in 2018](https://toolstud.io/calculate/exponential.php?datapoint1=1000000&datapoint2=2320000000&timeinbetween=14&timeinbetween_unit=31536000) (exponential growth)
  * Moore&#8217;s Law: [number of transistors on a chip doubles every 2 years (1990-2010)](https://toolstud.io/calculate/exponential.php?datapoint1=1000&datapoint2=1000000&timeinbetween=20&timeinbetween_unit=31536000) (exponential growth)
  * Business: [month on month double digit growth = x 3.14 per year](https://toolstud.io/calculate/exponential.php?datapoint1=100&datapoint2=110&timeinbetween=1&timeinbetween_unit=2628000) (exponential growth)<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
