#### 2006 &#8211; 2015: tinkering with ASP

I started developing small web tools all the way back in 2004. I think the first one was a simple RGB â‡† CMYK converter. The only scripting language I knew back then was [ASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_Server_Pages) (Windows/IIS), so I developed a set of ASP-based tools. They followed my interests: musical (BPM), crypto, sudoku, web-development&#8230; I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP while developing them, and the experience helped me a lot. In 2006 I decided to make them all available under one domain name. This was **web.forret.com**.

#### 2009: web.forret.com

Then, around 2009 I started working more and more exclusively with PHP. After a while, it became hard to go back and fix ASP bugs, so I left web.forret.com as it was, on its ASP island and dove into this new PHP world. And I started developing tools in PHP, things like an RSS feed checker, a depth-of-field calculator. However, I couldn&#8217;t put these tools on the same server as the older ones, because that server only did ASP, no PHP. I started by parking them under **tools.forret.com**, later hdslr-cinema.com with some others, and it just looked like a big mess. Different layouts, different sub-domains, different logic.

#### 2015: start of [toolstud.io](https://toolstud.io)

In 2015 I finally decided that I should clean up and consolidate. I purchased this new domain name **toolstud.io**, used better PHP templating, source code version control, a more modern layout, and the some self-developed libraries. And I started the work of converting my ASP-based tools to PHP. It&#8217;s not rocket science, and every tool in PHP worked better than the old ASP one, but I just needed to find the time.
