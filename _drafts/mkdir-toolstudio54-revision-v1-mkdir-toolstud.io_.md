I finally made the decision to move my somewhat popular [web.forret.com](http://web.forret.com) subdomain, with its collection of web-based calculation and conversion tools, over to its own web site. I will migrate the most important applications to [toolstud.io](http://toolstud.io), while also redeveloping them from ASP (yes, I know, theyâ€™re that old) to PHP, my current scripting language of choice. I will also try to migrate some applications from [tools.forret.com](http://tools.forret.com) over to here too.

I will also use this occasion to upgrade to all the latest versions of my PHP tool libraries (parsing, mrtg, visualisation) and to a modern layout system (probably Bootstrap).

I took the domain name and the hosting on [gandi.net](http://gandi.net), which is also a first tryout.
