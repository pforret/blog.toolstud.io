The [BPM (beats-per-minute) calculator](https://toolstud.io/music/bpm.php) was up for an update. 
The calculator is used to calculate the tempo and the duration of audio effects like delay and LFO.

The calculator was originally created years ago, still included never-used signatures like 4:7 and didn't look good on mobile devices (not responsive).

## Desktop

This is what it now looks like on a desktop browser:

## Mobile

And this is what it looks like on mobile:
[120 BPM, in 16 fractions](https://toolstud.io/music/bpm.php?bpm=120&bpm_unit=4%2F4&base=16)
