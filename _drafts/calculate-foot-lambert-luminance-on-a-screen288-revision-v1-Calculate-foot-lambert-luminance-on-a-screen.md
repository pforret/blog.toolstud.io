In the projection business, there is a unit for &#8216;_how much light is coming from that screen, actually_?&#8217;. This is called the **foot-Lambert** or ftL 

A cinema screen requires between 10 and 15 ftL If it&#8217;s lower (e.g. the projector lamp is not strong enough or the screen is too large), the image is too dark, and the white is rather grey (remember the [Long Night episode of Game of Thrones](https://www.cnet.com/news/game-of-thrones-cinematographer-defends-too-dark-episode/)?).

If the footLambert is too high (over dimensioned lamp) , the dark scenes become too bright, and it hurts the eyes.

Calculate the foot-Lambert like this:
